            "details":"In April, 1795, a number of slaves were arrested at Pointe Coupee for plotting to rise up and kill their masters in order to abolish slavery. The conspiracy was organized from the estate of Julien Poydras. The plan was to set fire to a building on the Poydras estate, and when masters from neighboring estates rushed to put out the fire, they would be slaughtered. The slaves would then take arms and ammunition from Poydras store and wipe out the remaining masters, as well as the creole slaves who refused to become involved in the plot. Although Poydras' slaves were the most numerous among the accused, slaves throughout Pointe Coupee and False River and several local whites were also involved. (GW Hall p.344). 15 slaves from the estate were convicted in the conspiracy (GW Hall, p.364).",
